The proof of pudding is in the eating, so let's use it -- as one system of many, not a single point of failure -- and find out how well it holds against attacks, once there's sufficient incentive to wage such. If there is such an incentive, there will be several such alternative, unrelated currency systems so the probability of them all being successfully attacked within a short period of time is effectively zero.

&gt; The total eventual circulation of Bitcoins will be 21,000,000 coins. There will never be more coins than that. The coins are entering circulation gradually, at a steady pace over many years, to nodes supporting the network in proportion to the CPU time they contribute.

also:

&gt; There's a constant average rate of new Bitcoins created, and that amount is divided among the nodes by the CPU power they use. When Bitcoins start having real exchange value, the competition for coin creation will drive the price of electricity needed for generating a coin close to the value of the coin, so the profit margin won't be that huge. The easier way to gain a lot of wealth would be trading

17,[deleted],"TL;DR: This is basically nonsense, economically-speaking.

In a barter economy an exchange occurs when two individuals each produce something which takes time/labor/capital and which the other person values more than what they're giving up.  For example, if I grow an apple, and you grow an orange, and we trade, [it is clear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference) that I value the orange more than the apple, and you value the apple more than the orange (otherwise we wouldn't have made the exchange).  The [value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value) of those items is individually subjective, and the supply of those items is constrained by market forces (e.g., alternate uses of time, labor, and capital).

A money economy emerges from a barter economy when individuals accept in exchange something they do not want for itself, but with the anticipation that they can use it for some future exchange.  It is critical that the commodity in question be desirable *eventually*.  If no one ever wants it, then it wouldn't emerge as money. (Aside: once a commodity begins to function as money, part of the demand for the commodity will be *as money*, thus there is positive feedback loop, but some non-money demand needs to exist to get the process running.  This is why all functioning fiat currencies have their roots in a commodity money.)

It's important to notice that commodity money has some *inherent* constraint on its creation (i.e., its supply curve is bounded by market forces), and that it satisfies the wants of others (i.e., there exists some demand curve).  For example, the gold supply is constrained by the cost of mining/processing new gold, and the demand affected by its consumption into produced goods and demand to hold ""cash balances"" of gold.

So far as I can tell, `bitcoin` is a scheme whose total supply is constrained only by an exogenous, artificial limit of 21M coins, and not by the demand for alternative uses of its [factors of production](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factors_of_production). There can be, *at most*, a [marginal value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalism) equal to the marginal cost of producing a coin, which appears to be nothing but otherwise-idle computer time and some electricity.

But far more importantly, this is a scheme whereby artificial scarcity is created (e.g., it takes `n` hours to produce a coin) but no thing of value is produced.  This would be akin to inventing a system of money involving sticks whittled into perfect cylinders.  Sure it might take a long time to create one, and it might consume resources, but if the end result doesn't have any value to anyone, it isn't money, it's just waste.

There's no intrinsic value in the work done for the proof, it's just a means to combat fraud and to (somewhat evenly) distribute free bitcoins among the early participants. It looks like the rate of generation is constant over the system, so the more people that are generating bitcoins, the longer it takes for each to generate one bitcoin.

Once all 21 million bitcoins are out there, the only way to get any is by trading them for something (else) of value, e.g. a carton of eggs, or a car, or (8 hours of) your time. So in the end, the value of the bitcoin will be determined by the market.",1278913050

No offense, but learn to read. This is addressed in the FAQ at Bitcoin.

* Each transacton includes a header that begins the creation of a new coin. The owner of the coin is whoever processed that initial block once the creation is completed.

* The system can be supported either through currency creation or transaction fees in its transaction headers.

* Per the line I quoted, they can transition from one to the other.

There is no technical reason given to establish how this system prevents the creation of currency beyond the 2.1 million coin limit.

The implementer indicates the creation rate will be stepped down once certain points have been reached, but that stepping down process is not built into the crypto exchange system as detailed in the FAQ.

His methods of preventing duplication of transactions and other forms of fraud appear sound (I can't see any flaws, at least), but the means by which the transition from currency creation to transaction fees is not documented.

Obviously, this makes it impossible to demonstrate that the transition will occur as planned and will be irreversible once completed.

The implementation could be left as-is and continue to generate Bitcoins in excess of the 2.1 million ""cap"" at the sole whim of its creator. There is zero documentation (and hence no mathematical demonstration) that the transition is implemented in a way that cannot be changed.

His FAQ does show a very creative and sound system for exchange. If his implementation of that system is equally sound, I will be awed.

There is, however, no clear indication of how the proposed creation-to-fee transition occurs. If he is capable of initiating such a transition, there needs to be a valid explanation of how---on a technical or mathematical basis---this transition will be irreversible.",1287088394

55,doublec,"&gt; And the computational difficulty of creating a coin is being set by the implementer. Right now, his plan is to step up the difficulty at set levels.

The difficulty is not set by the implementer. It is computed from the moving average of the previous blocks computations to target a difficulty such that block generation occurs at roughly the same blocks per hour no matter how much computing resource is thrown at it.

This is mentioned in the  ""Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system"" paper. ",1287227370
56,TimeAwayFromHome,"That much is clear and not relevant. The moving average referenced here targets a specific rate of coin creation. It is the variable rate of coin that I identify as the problem.

In other words, read the second section after the one you quoted. Transitions don't occur magically. The creation rate is tapering off. Where is that set? What guarantees it tapers off to 0 (to prevent inflation)?

There is no mathematical demonstration to ensure these outcomes because it is a simple software setting that determines whether nodes attempt to generate new coins or not. It is not built into the exchange algorithm, and the step-down process is not documented in technical detail at all.

The net result of this is: you have the word of Satoshi Nakamoto that currency creation will taper off and cease according to schedule; there is no technical mechanism that prevents an updated version of the Bitcoin client from deviating from the schedule or reversing the transition to fees.",1287431959
57,TimeAwayFromHome,"The algorithm cannot be a straight geometric difficulty, as this would not account for spontaneous increases in computation.

We know that computational capacity doubles every couple of years, but that is not the only thing which affects the computing power available to the Bitcoin network.

It must also adjust its creation rate to account for losing nodes due to political/economic/social pressures (or gaining nodes for the same reasons).

As doublec mentioned in his response to me, Bitcoin uses a moving average to ensure the creation rate remains at its baseline setting regardless of changes in node activity.

According to the creator, the baseline creation rate should taper off over the next 10-20 years. There is, however, no indication of what prompts this reduction to occur or how the reduction is effected.

If the reduction in coin creation happens because a magic date is set in the application that basically tells it to ""taper off starting 2012 May 1"", there is nothing preventing Mr Nakamoto from changing that date in the next version of the client.

If the reduction happens because of some as-yet unknown feedback mechanism, this hypothetical mechanism would be brilliant, ingenious, and... not documented in any way on the Bitcoin web site.",1287436063

Bitcoin generation can work on top of any computation space that takes increasing amounts of time as more solutions are found (coin scarcity), and has the ability to prove that computation work was done. That is, the resulting computed value (the coin) should be easily self-evident.

If any useful problems fit the criteria, and I'm sure there are, they could be used as the basis for coins. But the idea is that after a certain number of coins are initially computed, few more will ever be computed later. The window where solving the important problem remains profitable is a short one.

The other part is the proof-of-work when transferring coins, and this is the majority of the computation work. This computation problem is much more strict: it has to be highly consistent in required work (bitcoin counts the number of 0's in a sha-256 hash), and it has to be adjustable to increase the required work as computers get faster. Unfortunately, I don't think there are any useful problems that fit this criteria.

I see it like this: 

1) Some authority generates folding tasks -- initial configurations, initial energy and target energy. Task is signed by authority.

2) Cash miner runs stochastic optimization alrogithms aiming to get energy lower than target for given task. If he finds one he can use it as proof-of-work to get a bitcoin, for example.

3) One who wants to verify proof-of-work needs get original task and optimized configuration. Then he can compute energy for optimized configuration and check whether it matches goal. If it matches, then work is proven.

Of course, it is stochastic -- sometimes you can cheaply find a good configuration, sometimes it is not solveable at all. But I guess task-giving-authority can make targets to be reasonable and solvable _on average_.

Miner should probably try to optimize multiple tasks in order to avoid spending too much time on unsolveable tasks.

Note that hashcash is probabilistic too -- it is possible that you find right hash on your first try. However, on average you need that many iterations to find right cash.

Using folding for proof-of-work is MUCH more hassle and it is much harder to tune it so it actually works but in theory it is doable.

Not scalable, though, because you need some authority to generate tasks with sane complexity estimations.

81,alienangel2,"&gt; Although, I think an energy-backed currency is an interesting idea that needs to be taken seriously and explored further.

A new currency backed by CPU cycles did launch recently, and it is a serious effort, not a joke (although likely to come under legal attack from Governments because of how hard it is to regulate): http://www.bitcoinblogger.com/2010/11/bitcoin-gains-legal-protection-through.html

Basically it's backed by computational power, so you can earn it by providing or promising time on a computer for arbitrary programs to execute. There are also demo schemes that let you earn a few cents by manually solving things like captchas, since that's effectively processing too, and a type that computers aren't very good at yet.

**edit**: actually I'm dumb and misrepresent how the currency works, as [zxvf points out below](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/e8lev/a_chemist_explains_why_gold_beat_out_lithium/c167548) - you should read the FAQ for actual discussion of how it should work.",1290182945

&gt; Bitcoin has value because it is accepted as payment by many. The initial market value was achieved when people speculated, that because of its properties, the currency would be accepted by others later on.

&gt; When we say that a currency is backed up by gold, we mean that there's a promise in place that you can exchange the currency for gold. In a sense, you could say that Bitcoin is ""backed up"" by the price tags of merchants and currency exchangers – a price tag is a promise to exchange goods for a specified amount of currency. Of course, price tags may or may not be as long-term promises as those made by central banks or governments.

&gt; It's a common misconception that Bitcoins gain their value from the cost of electricity required to generate them. Cost doesn't equal value – hiring 1,000 men to shovel a big hole in the ground may be costly, but not valuable. Also, even though scarcity is a critical requirement for a useful currency, it alone doesn't make anything valuable.

83,zxvf,"It's not supposed to be fair. It's just a way to have a trickle of new bitcoin that's up for grabs. Why this is preferable to creating it all up front should be obvious. [The trickle is adjusting for Moore's law though](http://www.bitcoin.org/faq#How_are_new_Bitcoins_created).

&gt; New coins are generated by a network node each time it finds the solution to a certain calculational problem (i.e. creates a new block), for which an average solution time can be calculated. The difficulty of the problem is adjusted so that in the first 4 years of the Bitcoin network, 10,500,000 coins will be created. The amount is halved each 4 years, so it will be 5,250,000 in years 4-8, 2,625,000 in years 8-12 and so on. Thus the total number of coins will approach 21,000,000 over time.",1290188973
84,killerstorm,"Sorry, but you got it wrong. 

It is money backed by cryptography which is used to guarantee scarsity (nobody can create money from air) and validity of transaction (coin cannot be spent twice).

CPU cycles are needed to make this cryptography work and it is constantly donated by all members of network. Each contributing member can earn some money from time to time -- it encourages people to contribute.

Some more details on how it works -- validity of transactions can be checked by checking whole transaction history: you can trace history of each individual coin to verify it valid and person who claims to own it owns it. So it boils down to keeping history intact.

But malicious people could present their own version of history where they own more money then they actually do. It is similar to counterfeiting money in real world.

So how do you know whether history is valid or counterfeited? If there was a central server it could just sign history and so verification would boil down to checking signature.

However BitCoin is a distributed system with no central authority. So peers have to have verification method among themselves.

That's where CPU cycles are used. History consists of a chain of blocks and each peer tries to create a new block attached to previous one -- this block will include history of transactions since last block and a cryptographic hash which servers as proof-of-work. Basically, it is hard to compute hash of a certain form, and if one was able to compute it that means that he spent certain amount of CPU cycles.

When peer creates new block he adds a transaction which gives him new coins so peers are interested in creating new blocks.

When new peers connect they do not have transaction history themselves and they have to trust blocks they see. Suppose that there are both good peers and bad peers in network and good peers will show real history chain and bad peers will show counterfeited history chain. How new peers can find which is real? It is simple -- real is longer as long as good peers have more CPU power than bad peers. Good peers will only attach new history blocks to valid blocks, ignoring counterfeited blocks. So their efforts add up.

They say that one person controls like 25% of computing power on BitCoin network. If that would be 55% he could start counterfeiting blocks. So it is crucial to have as many members as possible to donate their CPU cycles into building history chain.

So, indeed, CPU cycles can earn you BitCoins, but those cycles are wasted on cryptographic tasks only meaningful inside the network. They do not do any useful tasks.

And, by the way, it is pretty hard to earn anyhing with a simple CPU. For example, one core of my Core 2 Duo 2.1 GHz yields about 800 khashes/sec. At this rate mean time to generate one block is 266 days. One block is 50 bitcoins which is like $10.

So I need almost a year to earn $10.

People having high-performance video cards can earn more, but still, I doubt it is very profitable.",1290190182

 Here is a example of a worst case scenario. In a global economy with 8-billion people the average value of a bitcoin wallet is 0.002625 BTC and the entire system having ~21-million BTC. Approximately 56-million people die a day for a potential loss of 147,000 BTC per day due to lost wallets. Earliest complete exhaustion of BTC due to death-loss of wallets would be ~150 years. Given that the bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimals and the current world GDP is estimated at ~59-trillion USD the point which there aren't enough coins is actually when there are less than 1000 BTC; still less than a day of leeway. Fixed supply coinage like bitcoin would work if we can continually fraction the coins, but we cannot. Longer-term millennial-scale use of the BTC would still encounter this problem, but it is possible to reset the coin-issue system by restarting the hash target difficulty when supplies get too low. Another fix to the system would be to continually inflate the BTC supply at a fixed rate instead of decaying the payout with time. 

  Some potential solutions to key loss would be key escrow and good key backup procedures, though both options would need to be suitably secure to keep the transactions anonymous in non-failure mode. If someone can access your key, they have access to all your money and transaction data. This would, at least, ensure that death and small-scale disasters do not cause such a rapid deterioration of the bitcoin supply.

In addition to getting the free 50 bitcoins for finding a block you can also get a transaction fee for packaging pending transactions into your block.

The length of a transaction train is variable. This means that the more cpu is in the network the more cpu is required to prove a transaction.

current transactions are limited to 2 decimal places with a very small operator free for passing the transaction. You'd need a lot of coins to successfully DDoS the network with transactions.

Consider for example the mtgox (bitcoin trading platform) APIs. It's quite easy to rig up a payment page where you accept bitcoins and then immediately sell them for USD at the time of sale.

There are still advantages to be had from accepting bitcoin payments even if you immediately dispose of the ones you acquire.

Payments cannot be revoked. This means you can  accept payments from completely anonymous and untrustable parties without first going through any process to first establish trust or even identity.

This might be especially useful with micropayments where any process to establish trust would create more friction than could be recovered from the micropayment.

It would also be great for anyone dealing in products or services that experience unusually high levels of fraud/chargebacks. You are essentially offloading your risk management onto other bitcoin market participants (ie: whoever sold your customer their bitcoins) but some of them may be in a better position to do that than you; maybe they have an existing trust relationship with your client for instance.

So, imagine that bitcoins are gold in the world, and leaving your computer running, helping the p2p network, is like the act of searching for bitcoin. When you ""find"" bitcoins, it's like finding gold, yes? And since the amount of bitcoins is limited, then eventually all of it will be found, or generated.

114,theymos,"Check out the Bitcoin wiki once it comes back online.

Bitcoin was designed to be very like gold. When generating, you calculate SHA-256 hashes for a ""block"". Creating a valid block currently creates 50 bitcoins for you, but this amount is halved every four years. This halving is what makes the supply limited: no matter what the allowable Bitcoin precision is, you always end up with slightly less than 21 million coins.

The hashing is basically like generating random numbers in a way that is verifiable by the rest of the network. In order for your block to be valid, the hash (a number) must be below a certain target number. This is extremely unlikely with only one hash, so you need to modify a nonce in your block and try many times. The target number is adjusted to make generating more or less difficult. The goal is to have 6 blocks created per hour network-wide. Currently it takes 34,696,113,864,173 hashes on average to find a valid block, but the process is heavily chance-based.

Blocks are also used to permanently store transactions to prevent double-spending attacks. This is their main purpose, in fact. You can see the transactions and blocks at my web tool here: http://blockexplorer.com/",1291178381

The wiki is back online now, so read this:
http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=block

Blocks (just some data) are composed of a copy of some recent transactions, a hash of the previous block, and some other data. Including the hash of a previous block creates a ""block chain"" -- each block is connected to the previous one. Because hashes are unpredictable and impossible to know in advance, this structure makes it nearly impossible to modify a block after it has been ""buried"" by a few other blocks in the chain. The block chain therefore guarantees strict ordering of the contained information: you know for sure that transactions in block C are older than ones in block F. The Bitcoin block chain is the first-ever distributed timestamp server.

To generate a block, you take the block template (several data fields) and fill it up with data dependent on the network's current state. Then you hash the block. If the hash is less than the target (determined by current difficulty), your block is valid and you can publish it, and the next block will build on your block. If it's not valid, you increment a nonce in the block and hash it again. Due to the properties of hashing, incrementing the nonce completely changes the hash in an unpredictable way. As I said in the post above, you need to do this trillions of times on average before you get a hash below the target number. But there is no ""progress"" to solving a block: each hash has a probability of solving the block, like flipping dozens of coins that must all come up heads to win.

Money transfer network. Free flow of money. ([BitCoin](http://www.bitcoin.org/) might work, however governments are scared shitless of the idea that people of the world can just transfer money without them knowing and chipping bits off it.)

Deposit, savings. 0 % real yield. Nothing fancy, just tracks inflation. This in turn represents a question of should one pay for this service? If you let the bank gamble with your money, they should pay you; otherwise they're doing you a valuable service.

Investment. Risk for potential future profit. The main problem here is avoiding emergent risk of the whole investment system.

Financing. Farmers need money because a flood eradicated all their crops. Companies have to sometimes survive recessions, markets, prices, demand oscillate, but wages, bills, invoices should be paid. Personal/Consumer loans, mortgages, car-leasing, whatever.

Health insurance. The mathematical model is simple, each insured person has some chance of dying or suffering an accident (and this of course depends on their age, diet, habits, work environment, where they live, etc.) so with some statistics and black magic the insurer can calculate how much one should pay (as a function of how much they want to get).


Of course, lending and deposits are the traditional 2-in-1 functions of a bank, but maybe there's a better model. Also, it'd help to know the volumes of money each function handles.

189,capnza,"You are misundestanding me. I am not talking about interest rates. I am talking about money supply.

Once again: under both the current Federal Reserve note system and this proposed Bitcoin system the rate at which the money supply expands is controlled by a central authority.

How is the rate (of money supply increase, not interest rate) arbitrarily hard-coded into the Bitcoin system more effective than having a central bank increase (or decrease) the money supply as they currently do?",1293783325

What do you mean when you say ""more effective""?

I say a monetary authority is doing its job well when the currency it issues retains its value year after year, decade after decade. 

Being a store of value is one of the requirements of money. And to keep its value, a currency has to be in limited supply.  

The Fed could limit the supply of greenbacks, just like bitcoin does, but to do so would force the Fed to give up it's ability to control interest rates, which it does by printing more or less money. 

You say you want to talk only about money supply - but money supply and interest rates are inseperable. They are two sides of the same coin!
